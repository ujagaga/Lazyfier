I tried several remote controller apps for android to controll my desktop multimedia. 
They generally offer too much and load too slow. I decided to write my own lightweight app and server.

All you need to do is install on your computer lazyfier-5.0.deb.
It will automatically setup a shortcut to run at startup.
A hidden feature is holding play button longer sends space key command.
